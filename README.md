# My Dotfiles configuration
currently only support on arch linux for installation script, maybe i'll add some multi platform features on future

## Installation
- arch linux
    - Just use `./install.sh` script
- other platform and linux distro
    - Need to link with `ln` manually or just copy `cp` it
